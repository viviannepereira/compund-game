q5.js was designed to make creative coding fun and accessible for a new generation of artists, designers, educators, and beginners. 🤝

Familiar with p5? You'll be right at home with q5. It's like getting a free computer upgrade! 🖥️

```js
createCanvas(100, 100);
circle(50, 50, 50);
```

q5 doesn't replicate all of p5's functionality, but it's a superior alternative for many use cases. 🛠️

## Documentation

Browse the [q5 reference pages](https://q5js.org/learn) to learn how to use q5.js.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/q5js/q5.js/wiki) for extended documentation.

Use the [q5.d.ts](q5.d.ts) file in Visual Studio Code to get autocompletion and inline hover-over documentation. Simply add this `jsconfig.json` file to your project folder:

```json
{
	"compilerOptions": {
		"target": "ESNext"
	},
	"include": ["*.js", "*/*.js", "node_modules/q5/q5.d.ts"]
}
```
